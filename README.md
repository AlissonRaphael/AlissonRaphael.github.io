This repository contains an implementation of my professional portfolio page. The technologies used were ReactJS and some of its libraries.

I have a bachelor's degree in Science and Technology and a degree in Production Engineer from the Federal University of Rural do Semi√°rido.

Passionate about technology, I've always looked for solutions that would make it possible to insert businesses into the context of the fourth industrial revolution, until I was completely absorbed by the programming universe.

Since then I have been working fully as a professional freelancer, working with technologies both on the backend and on the frontend.
